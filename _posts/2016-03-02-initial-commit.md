I literally just started testing Jekyll's blog system.

{% highlight java %}
/*
* Highly professional code
* For highly professional coders
*/
class Test{

  //Look at those variable scopes!
  private int a;
  private int b;
  
  public Test()
  {
    //So professional!
    this.a = 1;
    this.b = 2;
  }
  
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    //Messing around with Jekyll's cool snippet system
    Test x = new Test();
    System.out.println("a is " + x.a + " and b is " + x.b);
  }
  
  //I haven't actually tried this on a compiler,
  //I'm not responsible PC's that get fried
  //because of how professional this code is.

}
{% endhighlight %}
