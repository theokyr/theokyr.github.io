When I was trying to come up with a gameplay hook for Ruby: Dark Influence (henceforth referred to as RDI), I came up with the idea of having Computers that change things in the environment of the game.

Obviously this idea had been done before, but "nothing is original" (tm) so I set out to do it anyway.

My first implementation was created when I was still quite novice in the dark magic of Unity.

It relied on tons upon tons of hacks and threw out exceptions all the time that I had no idea how to deal with.

That's when I figured I could re-write it, and not only that, but make it much more graphically appealing too.

It looks pretty, but I'm now torn on whether players should be forced to "bash" their way out of the game's puzzles.

The other day I saw my brother playing Second Sight on the PS2, developed by Free Radical (who went on to create the Timesplitters series).

Second Sight had a pretty complex but intuitive in-game computer system, which had a lot of features I had already thought up for RDI, such as watching a live camera feed from an actual camera inside the level.

At first I was shocked that a game from 2004 had such a well-built in-game computer system and felt devastated that my brilliant idea had aleady been made, and much better than I would have implemented it myself.

That didn't stop me from working on it, though. I plan on the next iteration to have more of a graphical interface (like Second Sight) but I will leave the terminal in for nerds like me (and perhaps make it necessary for more difficult modes of the game).

Thanks, Second Sight!
