What was Ruby (2014)?
=======

2014's Ruby game was a project I started to learn game development; it taught me some valuable lessons,
but was ultimately cancelled.

[Ruby: Dark Influence](./ruby) rose from the ashes of the Ruby 2014 project.

The games' first (and also last) build has been published on the devblog I now use for Dark Influence.
