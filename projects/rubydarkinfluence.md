What is Ruby: Dark Influence?
=======

It's a Sci-Fi First Person Shooter for Windows PC (also planned for Linux and Mac), built on Unity 5.

What is the game about?
=======

The game focuses on combat and exploration, while doing away with conventions of modern FPS such as regenerating health and overplayed military settings.

There are no cutscenes and the story never gets in the way of gameplay; it just exists to enhance the gameplay experience.

There's also an emphasis on puzzle solving that gets tougher as the game progresses.

You can learn more about Ruby: Dark Influence on its [dev blog](https://rubythegame.tumblr.com). I post video updates every few weeks.
